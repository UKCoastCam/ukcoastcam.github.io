<h1>About Coastcam.org</h1>

<p>
Coastcam.org is a free, independent directory of publicly available coastal, harbour and maritime webcams.
</p>

<p>
The site was created to make it easy to find live views of the coast — whether you're checking weather and sea conditions, planning a trip, keeping an eye on your home waters, or just enjoying the view.
</p>

<h2>What Coastcam.org Is (and Isn’t)</h2>

<p>
Coastcam.org does not operate or control any of the webcams listed on this site.
All webcams remain the property of their respective owners and operators.
</p>

<p>
We simply link to publicly available camera feeds and pages provided by:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Harbour authorities</li>
  <li>Sailing clubs and marinas</li>
  <li>Local councils and organisations</li>
  <li>Private individuals and businesses</li>
</ul>

<h2>Accuracy and Availability</h2>

<p>
Webcam availability, image quality and uptime can change without notice.
We aim to keep listings accurate, but some links may occasionally stop working or be moved.
</p>

<p>
If you spot a broken link or an incorrect location, we’d really appreciate you letting us know via the report a fault button on the main page.
</p>

<h2>Submitting a Webcam</h2>

<p>
If you run a coastal or maritime webcam and would like it included, or if you know of a publicly accessible webcam that isn’t listed yet, you can submit it using the Submit a coastal webcam button on the main page.
</p>

<p>
All submissions are reviewed before being added.
</p>

<h2>Why the Site Is Free</h2>

<p>
Coastcam.org is run as a personal project.
Any advertising shown helps cover basic running costs such as domain registration and site maintenance.
</p>

<p>
We aim to keep advertising minimal and unobtrusive.
</p>
