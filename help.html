  <h1>Help &amp; How to Use Coastcam.org</h1>

  <h2>Finding Webcams on the Map</h2>
  <p>
    The main page features an interactive map showing the locations of coastal, harbour and maritime webcams around the world. Each camera is marked with a map pin.
  </p>

  <h2>Searching for Places</h2>
  <p>
    By clicking on the magnifying glass in the top right of the map you can use a search box to find places by name. Start typing a city, town, beach, harbour, or landmark, and select from the suggestions. The map will zoom to your chosen location and then you can look for webcams nearby.
  </p>

  <h2>Webcam Clusters</h2>
  <p>
    When the map is zoomed out, webcams that are close together are grouped into clusters. These clusters show a number indicating how many webcams are in that area. As you zoom in, the clusters will break apart to show individual map pins. Click on a cluster to zoom in and reveal more webcams.
  </p>

  <h2>Viewing a Webcam</h2>
  <p>
    Click any map pin to see details about that webcam and a link to view the live feed. The webcam will open in a new tab or window.
  </p>

  <h2>Submitting or Reporting Webcams</h2>
  <p>
    If you know of a webcam that isn’t listed, or if you spot a broken link, use the “Submit a coastal webcam” or “Report a fault” buttons at the top of the main page.
  </p>

  <h2>The 🎲 Random Webcam button</h2>
  <p>
    On the main page there is a yellow 🎲 Random Webcam button. This is about as exciting as coastcam.org is going to get, enjoy!
